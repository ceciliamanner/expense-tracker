# Expense Tracking App

## Project Description
This project is part of the Frontend Development (FFU1200) course and demonstrates core concepts of React through the creation of a functional and interactive Expense Tracking App. The application allows users to manage their personal expenses using a clean, component-based interface built with React and React Hooks.

The app was developed using Vite and follows a functional programming approach. All data is stored in localStorage to ensure persistence across sessions.
